# JavaUtil

The problem of a developer is that you have to develop small snippets again and again, even though they have already been developed in a project. This project should contain a collection of useful snippets that you use over and over again.Feel free to expand this collection.

## Getting Started

You only have to integrate the Java project into your development environment. The required Lilbrarys are obtained via Maven.

There is no need to create an instance of an object because the methods can be statically retrieved. Here is an example of how to use a static function, for example:

```
util.String.notEmpty("Hello World!");
```
